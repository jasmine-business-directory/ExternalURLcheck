# ExternalURLcheck
Optimized for scalability and speed, the script serves as a free asset for anyone looking to perform advanced, automated URL analysis.


What the project does?

1. Reads URLs from a CSV file.
2. Checks the HTTP header status of each URL.
3. Populates the CSV with status codes, redirect locations, SSL issues, and other HTTP response metrics.
4. Writes this data back to an updated CSV file in real-time, ensuring timely insights into the URLs' status.
